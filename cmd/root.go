	This repository contains a collection of Terraform modules that aim to make it 
	easier and faster for customers to get started with a 3-tier-architecture in AWS. 
	It can be used to configure and provision a complete stack with
	
	* a static website served from S3 and AWS Cloudfront
	
	* a containerized backend/API running on AWS ECS
	
	* an AWS RDS MySQL/Postgres database
	
	* an AWS ElastiCache Redis
	
	It is the result of many projects we did for customers with similar requirements. 
	And rather than starting from scratch with every project, we've created reusable 
	Terraform modules. What started as an internal library, now evolved into a single 
	module we'd like to share and to give back to the community as open source.`,
