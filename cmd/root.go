	Hold on. What is Terra3, anyway? Terra3 is an opinionated Terraform module for 
	ramping-up 3-tier architectures in AWS in no time! Goto https://terra3.io for further information.
	
	The Terra3 CLI provides features to manage Terra3 stacks from the command line. It can
	
	* create a secure port-forward to the private RDS database using SSM 
	* manage environment hibernation (start/stop/status)
	* manage AWS secrets related to the environment
	* comfortably shelling into a container (if ECS exec is activated for the cluster)
	* and much more to come!
